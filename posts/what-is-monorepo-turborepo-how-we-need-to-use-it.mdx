When I write this post, I am working on [ResolveX.ai](https://resolvex.ai) project. It is a project that
helps small and medium-sized businesses to manage their customer support chats/emails/tickets on a single
platform with power of AI.

My first approach was to create a github organization and create multiple repositories for each service and
example related to the project. But I realized that it is not a good approach for me. Because I need to utilize
the same codebase in multiple services (ex: a simple function for simple components, ...). So I decided to
change my approach to [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/).

## What is monorepo?

Monorepo is a repository that contains multiple projects in same repository. It is a good approach for projects
that have multiple services and need to share some code between them.

## How create a monorepo with npm/yarn/pnpm?

With npm/yarn/pnpm workspace, you can create a very simple monorepo by create a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file
(in my case, I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)) and add your projects to it.

```yaml
packages:
  - "packages/*"
  - "apps/*"
```

And your project structure will be like this:

```
apps/
	docs/
		package.json
	web/
		package.json
packages/
	ui/
		package.json
	config/
		package.json
package.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

The pnpm workspace simple manage all dependencies in single lock file only. and you can install local packages
in your apps like a normal npm package.

For example in my `docs` app:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"@resolvex/ui": "workspace:^",
	}
}
```

That will tell pnpm to install `@resolvex/ui` package from workspace instead of npm registry. Now you have
been resolved the reusability problem and have a simple monorepo.

## Why I need to use turborepo for my monorepo?

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a tool that helps you to manage your monorepo. It will help you simplify
some tasks like: build, test, deploy, ...

Without turborepo:

```bash
cd workspace/apps/docs
pnpm run build
cd ../web
pnpm run build
cd ../../packages/ui
pnpm run build
```

With turborepo:

```bash
cd workspace
pnpm run build
```

Oke but I also create a specific `build` script in root package.json. So why I need to use turborepo?
Because turborepo will help you to run your scripts in parallel, and only run scripts when codebase in that
package has been changed. So it will help you to save a lot of time.

And many other features like: remote cache, environment variables, ...
